TODO:

hashlife -_- :

- pars rle (adapt existing code in last version)
- build qtree with the map

- implement perfect hash table with linear complexity

- learn how to hash a struct in order (nw, ne, sw, se) and build struct can be compared

- recurs on qtree:
    if pattern size = 2 * 2 apply life game rules, hash and stock pattern and return
    else if pattern n * n exist yet return n - 1 * n - 1 pattern at next generation
    else recurs on every quadrant of node to an existing pattern or 2 * 2 pattern

    if pattern does't exist hash and stock it
    return it

- print it
