TODO:

hashlife -_- :

√ = seems good

√ - pars rle (adapt existing code in last version)
√ - build qtree with the map

- implement perfect hash table with linear complexity

- learn how to hash a struct in order (nw, ne, sw, se) and build struct can be compared

- add number of population in each node ???

√ - recurs on qtree:
    if pattern size = 2 * 2 apply life game rules, hash and stock pattern and return
    else if pattern n * n exist yet return n - 1 * n - 1 pattern at next generation
    else recurs on every quadrant of node and 5 tmp quadran (top : (nw.ne, ne.nw, nw.se, ne.sw) ; right : (ne.sw, ne.se, se.nw, se.ne) ; bot : (sw.ne, se.nw, sw.se, se.sw) ; left : (nw.sw, nw.se, sw.nw, sw.ne) ; midle : (nw.se, ne.sw, sw.ne, se.nw))
    on final return result of recurs on the for quadrant created by the 9 recursion // << compute 2^n-2 generation forward
    // total: 13 recursion
- print it // how ??? >>  is it okay?

- hash
    take 4 pointer and complete node
        hash pointer//how???
        check if exist?
            return pointer corresponding
        else
            store hash as key, node pointer as value in hash table; return pointer

incompris:

    hash the pointer
    when expand univers
√   see at end, why calculate n - 2 generation forward and how to do it << start to understand
